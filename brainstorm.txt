When I saw the NES controller -> 8-directional game
Out of control -> directions switch ever so often

There was this space mining game, after enough upgrade to speed the spaceship didn't have powerful breaking
and would oversteer

Combining the two, a scroller air game where you can't break fast enough.
Collecting certain pickups cause directions to switch.

Addictions!!!
You are the president of a teenager mind. You have to organise their subconsience
so that they don't get addicted. Not sure what gameplay would look like. But the lore is fun
Could make relatable too, like not falling hard for crush who doesn't like you back.

Multiplying
A game where destroying an enemy generates 2. Soon enough everything will be overwhelmed.
Alternatively, not destroying them leads to them multiplying on their own after a set time

Swapping controls:
I realised that if notes on the keyboard were switched, I'd have tough time typing.
Perhaps that could be turned into a mechanic. Or a piano, if the keys were switched.
This needs to be implemented carefully since it needs to be fun, not frustating.
Ties back to the first idea I had

I keep thinking of the scroller idea. There aren't any enemies. Just collectibles,
and the occasional obsticles. Hitting the walls, kills you.
4 controls - left, right, fire and boost(forward, uncontrollable)
Shooting enemies splits them into 2, but they split at 45deg angles keeping you in a safe path.
Enemies bounce and ricochet off walls. Collectibles swap controls

I really love the addications idea. I think its a novel intepretation. just can't figure out a gameplay mechanic
I don't want it to be boring. Personally, I don't like management games much - they're basically idle clicker imos

A platformer, or rougelike - where tiles pop in and out of existence randomly
